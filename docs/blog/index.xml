      <description>November 10, 2019 With v0.24.0, WTF now has better support for theme-like colour settings. It&amp;rsquo;s far from perfect, a lot of modules will have to be improved internally to make theming ubiquitous, but it&amp;rsquo;s a start.
By way of example, if you&amp;rsquo;re running v0.24 or later, drop this into your config at the top, replace your existing colors: YAML block with the following and you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a facsimile of an old-school green monochrome monitor display (you may need to restart WTF to get changes to take effect).</description>

Copy   wtfutil The name has changed because calling it wtf caused a collision with the venerable and amusing bsd-wtf utility. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem back when there was only one person using WTF and no one else knew about it, but with the rise in popularity this collision has been causing problems for some people.</description>
